# no-early-nine
This project is used for students who don't want to wake up for iclicker questions
You must have selenium and python installed
Do not modify any part of the code except strings
I have added comments to all the places where you need personalization
You will need:
1. The time in which you usually start check-in (you can comment it out and run by hand if you don't need this)
2. Your iclicker gmail and password
3. Your classroom location (latitude and longitude) if your iclicker requires a certain classroom
4. Your iclicker class name (you don't need the full name just parts of it)

This project only works for multiple-choice poll questions. By default, it will only answer option A. You have to change the setting by choice
